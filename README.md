<h1>SQL Query Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this scenario, you have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred. After completeing this lab, you will have practical experience in running basic SQL queries to

    select specific columns from a table,
    select all columns from a table by using an asterisk (*), and
    sort query results using the ORDER BY keyword.

These basic queries form the foundation for running more advanced queries and applying filters later.
